# ðŸŒ± oats

This project aims to provide a solution for generating quality Typescript code from API-describing documents. The only supported format currently is [OpenAPI 3.x](https://www.openapis.org), but there are plans introduce generators for [AsyncAPI](https://www.asyncapi.com/) as well.

The goal is to minimize the boilerplate a human developer has to write, to reduce the tedium around keeping a client and a server in sync, and to allow devs to focus on just displaying or moving data, without worrying about the correctness of that data.

# Why?

You might ask, why does this project exists? There are countless OpenAPI generators out there. The main goals are:

- Make any part of the API replaceable in case it doesn't suit your needs.
- Make the API easy to customize to suit a wide variety of use cases out of the box.
- Make the generated code as easy to read, as if a dev would have written it by hand.
